# Functional Changes Made to This Codebase

*This project is based on the excellent [react-portfolio-template](https://github.com/yujisatojr/react-portfolio-template) by Yuji Sato. Customizations and functional changes have been made as described below.*

## 1. Theme Default Changed to Light Mode
- The application now loads in light mode by default. Users can still toggle between light and dark themes.

## 2. Organizations Section
- A new `Organizations` component was created to showcase logos of previous employers and clients.
- Logos are imported as images and displayed in a responsive, visually prominent row below the career timeline.
- The section heading was updated to "Previous Clients & Employers" for clarity.

## 3. Timeline and Section Layout
- The `Organizations` section was moved to appear below the career timeline for better narrative flow.
- The size and spacing of organization logos were adjusted for optimal fit and appearance.

## 4. Asset and Import Improvements
- PNG and SVG logos are now imported using ES module imports for compatibility and reliability.
- Unused mock PNG files were removed from the project.

## 5. Education Section Readability
- Styles were updated to ensure the education section is readable in both light and dark modes.

## 6. General UI/UX Enhancements
- Spacing, font sizes, and layout were improved for a more modern and professional look.
- The site is now more visually appealing and mobile-friendly.
